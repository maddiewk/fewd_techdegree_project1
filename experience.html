        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>I began my music studies when I was six. My mother was a pianist and she taught me piano at home all the way until I graduated high school. I began learning the violin when I was eight years old and I loved it so much that it became my main instrument.</p>
        <p>When I started to get serious about having a career in music, I began entering local and state competitions, performing regularly at different venues, and participating in many different youth orchestras. I received my Bachelor's degree in violin performance at the University of Maryland in 2013.</p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>I began my coding journey in the winter of 2017. It started as a curiosity of what the industry was all about, since my father is a software developer. After I learned a little bit of HTML, my interest was piqued and I wanted to learn even more. So when I stumbled upon Treehouse, I knew that I wanted to sign up for one of the Techdegree tracks.</p>
